# AWS Three-Tier Web Application Architecture

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a highly available and scalable three-tier web application architecture on AWS. The architecture consists of a presentation tier (web), application tier (app), and database tier (data), following AWS best practices for security and performance.

## Architecture Components

### Presentation Tier (Web Layer)
- **Route 53**: DNS web service
- **CloudFront**: Content delivery network
- **Application Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming traffic
- **EC2 Instances**: Hosts web servers in multiple AZs
- **Auto Scaling Group**: Maintains application availability

### Application Tier (App Layer)
- **EC2 Instances**: Application servers running business logic
- **Auto Scaling Group**: Automatically adjusts capacity
- **Private Subnets**: Secured environment for app servers
- **NAT Gateway**: Enables internet access for private resources

### Database Tier (Data Layer)
- **Amazon RDS**: Managed relational database service
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: High availability configuration
- **Private Subnets**: Isolated database environment

## Security Features
- VPC with public and private subnets
- Network ACLs and Security Groups
- SSL/TLS encryption for data in transit
- AWS KMS for data encryption at rest
- AWS WAF for web application firewall protection

## High Availability Features
- Multiple Availability Zone deployment
- Auto-scaling groups for dynamic scaling
- Load balancing for traffic distribution
- RDS Multi-AZ deployment
- Regular automated backups

## Monitoring and Logging
- CloudWatch for resource monitoring
- CloudTrail for API activity logging
- VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring
- RDS logging for database activities
- SNS for alerts and notifications

## Cost Optimization
- Auto-scaling based on demand
- Reserved instances for predictable workloads
- S3 lifecycle policies
- Cost allocation tags
- Regular cost analysis and optimization

## Performance Optimization
- CloudFront for content delivery
- ElastiCache for session management
- Read replicas for database scaling
- Instance right-sizing
- Performance monitoring and tuning

## Disaster Recovery
- Regular automated backups
- Cross-region replication capability
- Documented recovery procedures
- Regular DR testing schedule
- RPO and RTO objectives

## Implementation Steps
1. **VPC Setup**
   - Create VPC with appropriate CIDR block
   - Configure public and private subnets
   - Set up Internet and NAT gateways

2. **Security Configuration**
   - Configure Network ACLs
   - Set up Security Groups
   - Implement IAM roles and policies

3. **Web Tier Deployment**
   - Launch EC2 instances
   - Configure Auto Scaling
   - Set up Application Load Balancer

4. **Application Tier Setup**
   - Deploy application servers
   - Configure scaling policies
   - Implement security measures

5. **Database Tier Configuration**
   - Set up RDS instance
   - Configure Multi-AZ deployment
   - Implement backup policies

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add container orchestration with ECS/EKS
- [ ] Implement blue-green deployment
- [ ] Add API Gateway integration
- [ ] Enhance monitoring with custom metrics

## Best Practices Implemented
